    ///     this optimization is turned off! When you turn it on, you must
    ///     provide correct bounding boxes for all primitives, in particular
    ///     along the z-axis.

    ///   - CameraOutsideOptimization: This setting enables rendering
    ///     optimizations that are only valid if the camera is known to be
    ///     outside of the CSG model. I.e., if the camera is inside of the
    ///     CSG model and the setting is enabled, rendering errors occur
    ///     that could be avoided otherwise. By default, this setting is
    ///     enabled(!) for the SCS, but disabled for the Goldfeather algorithm.
    ///     See the remarks for the two algorithms for details.

    ///     For the Goldfeather algorithm, the setting controls how the parity
    ///     is calculated. The parity value is the number of surfaces in front
    ///     of the surface for that visibility is about to be determined. The
    ///     textbook approach to determine it is to render all surfaces that
    ///     are in front (z-pass). This has the drawback, though, that if the
    ///     camera is inside of the CSG model, some surfaces could be clipped
    ///     by the view frustum, resulting that rendering is not correct. The
    ///     alternative approach is to render surfaces behind (z-fail). With
    ///     that, clipping of the surfaces is much less likely to happen and
    ///     easy to avoid. So this is the more robust setting and OpenCSG uses
    ///     it by default. The performance of the two approaches is usually
    ///     similar. If the camera is outside of the CSG model, you may enable
    ///     the CameraOutsideOptimization setting to check if it somehow works
    ///     better for your.

    ///     In the SCS algorithm, the setting controls the workings in the
    ///     subtraction phase of the algorithm. When subtracting a primitive
    ///     relative to the current z-buffer, the default, textbook approach
    ///     is to mark the visible, front-facing polygons of the primitive in
    ///     the stencil buffer. (At these places then the z-buffer is updated
    ///     with the back-facing polygons behind the z-buffer). This approach
    ///     however fails if the front faces of the subtracted primitive are
    ///     clipped. The alternative, more compatible approach renders the
    ///     primitive even one more time to avoid this problem. That approach,
    ///     in OpenCSG, is disabled by default, i.e., by default the
    ///     CameraOutsideOptimization is enabled. This is for two reasons:
    ///     * SCS still does not handle all cases correctly with the
    ///       CameraOutsideOptimization that is disabled. In particular,
    ///       if the front, intersected primitives are clipped by the view
    ///       frustum, rendering is incorrect. An example is the pipe model
    ///       in the example application.
    ///     * The more compatible approach is also consistently slower.

    /// Each optimization can be independently set
    ///   - OptimizationDefault     to its default value
    ///   - OptimizationForceOn     on (does not check OpenGL extensions)
    ///   - OptimizationOn          on if required OpenGL extensions are supported,
