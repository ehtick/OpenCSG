Microsoft Visual Studio 2022
----------------------------

The Visual Studio solution OpenCSG_vc2022.sln assumes that freeglut
is put in a freeglut/ subdirecty in the OpenCSG installation directory.
This works, for example, with the freeglut 3.0.0 MSVC package available
from https://www.transmissionzero.co.uk/software/freeglut-devel

The Visual Studio solutions automatically builds GLEW, the opencsg
lib, and the example. The solution allows to create both 64- and 32-bit
builds. To run the example, you must copy the freeglut.dll
into the directory example/Release/ or example/Debug/ where the
opencsgexample.exe has been built. Be sure to pick the correct
64- or 32-bit version of the dll.


Microsoft Visual Studio 6
-------------------------

The Visual Studio 6 solution OpenCSG.dsw assumes that the original
GLUT for Windows is setup as described in
https://user.xmission.com/~nate/glut.html

The solution automatically builds the opencsg lib, and the example.


Linux
-----

1) As prerequisites, you must install OpenGL development packages,
   and, for the example application, glut. To create the makefiles,
   additionally you need CMake.
2) Just type:

   cmake CMakeLists.txt

   This will generate the makefiles in the src and example directory.
   To create makefiles with optimizations enabled, maybe type instead
 
   cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release CMakeLists.txt

   Then type:

   make

3) The OpenCSG library will have been build in src/, and the example
   "opencsgexample" will reside in the example/ directory. To run the
   opencsg example, you must ensure that libopencsg.so lib is in your
   LD_LIBRARY_PATH (e.G., one way to do this is to copy it to /usr/local/lib
   and running "ldconfig -v"). 'make install' is an automatic way to
   copy the build and the example into /usr/local (requires write access
   to /usr/local)


Dev-C++ 5.11
------------

As prerequisite, get the freeglut 3.0.0 MinGW Package from
https://www.transmissionzero.co.uk/software/freeglut-devel/
and put it under freeglut into the opencsg directory.
Open OpenCSG.dev
Compile
Ensure that freeglut.dll is in the same directory as the
generated OpenCSG.exe, and start OpenCSG.exe.
